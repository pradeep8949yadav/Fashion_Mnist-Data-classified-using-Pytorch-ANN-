# Fashion_Mnist-Data-classified-using-Pytorch-ANN-
This project focuses on classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in PyTorch. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of grayscale images, each of size 28x28, belonging to one of 10 categories of clothing, such as shirts, shoes, and bags. 
# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying the Fashion-MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The ANN is trained to predict the correct category of fashion items, such as shirts, shoes, and bags, based on input images. The project covers the complete workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, and provides insights into neural network training techniques.

# Ressults
97-98 percent accuracy


This project serves as an excellent starting point for anyone looking to explore deep learning concepts using PyTorch. It provides a practical hands-on approach to image classification while highlighting best practices in ANN design and training.
